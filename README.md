# ANIMAL-RESCUE
#### Project made for CS50 - Final Project
#### Video Demo:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gfVfj8QBViY">Youtube Video</a>
#### Description:
<p>This project is a responsible webpage perfect for adoption shelters. This website uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Python (Flask), and PostgreSQL. Please have in mind that this is not an official website for adoption shelters. I am just a developer who wants to showcase a cool website, taking inspiration from websites like "Best Friends Animal Society", "Operation Kindness", "Petfinder", and "PawsChicago".</p>
<p>The website is divided into 2 main parts:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Clients webpage: </strong><h>https://animal-rescue-04.up.railway.app/login</h></li>
  <li><strong>Staff webpage: </strong><h>https://animal-rescue-04.up.railway.app/staff/login</h></li>
</ul>
<p>On the clients' webpage, the customers can log in, register, adopt a pet, volunteer, foster, or become an educator. The data submitted by the customers is saved to the database and uploaded to the Staff webpage. Staff members can log in, register, and check the new updates.</p>
<p>Finally, this website was made in honor of my best friend, brother, and pet <strong>Pancho</strong>. <strong>R.I.P.</strong> üê©‚ô•</p>
<p>So, please take around my website üòÑüôÉ</p>
<br>
<h3>Coming soon:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Update app.py file, so the user can edit/add information(register/send info by forms). Fix that issue by doing <code>INSERT INTO table (<strong>id</strong>, column1, column2, ...) VALUES (<strong>last_id+1</strong>, value1, value2, ...)</code>. Remember that there's no AUTOINCREMENT attribute on id's columns for every table.</li>
    <li>Create a table database for pets, so makes the website dynamic. </li>
</ul>
